### Github Repositories

* [Fergu3d](https://github.com/kjfergu/fergu3d)

    A work-in-progress design for a 3D printer utilitizing UV cured resin instead of the traditional ABS plastic. The goal is to eliminate the need for a hot printing surface which frequently results in warped parts.

* [TEXBook](https://github.com/kjfergu/texbook)

    Still very much a work in progress, this is an experiment in learning to write interfaces for cross platform use. The ultimate goal is for TEXBook to serve as a sort of "Lab Notebook", taking care of organizing individual notebook entries by date, and serving as a simple LaTeX editor and compiler for the resulting notebook.

* [HackPSU 2015](https://github.com/kjfergu/hackpsu2015)

    This is a website created with Amandeep Preimi during the HackPSU 2015 Hackathon at Penn State. It is a simple virtual soux chef, allowing you to interact with individual recipes using only your voice. The website makes use of google's voice recognition and speech APIs.
