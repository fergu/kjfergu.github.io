The goal is to eliminate the need for a hot printing surface which frequently results in warped parts.\r\n\r\n* [TEXBook](https://github.com/kjfergu/texbook)\r\n\r\n    Still very much a work in progress, this is an experiment in learning to write interfaces for cross platform use. The ultimate goal is for TEXBook to serve as a sort of \"Lab Notebook\", taking care of organizing individual notebook entries by date, and serving as a simple LaTeX editor and compiler for the resulting notebook.\r\n\r\n* [HackPSU 2015](https://github.com/kjfergu/hackpsu2015)\r\n\r\n    This is a website created with Amandeep Preimi during the HackPSU 2015 Hackathon at Penn State. It is a simple virtual soux chef, allowing you to interact with individual recipes using only your voice. The website makes use of google's voice recognition and speech APIs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### You can visit Kevin's [github page](https://github.com/kjfergu) to see all of his projects and view instructions for checking out the code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
